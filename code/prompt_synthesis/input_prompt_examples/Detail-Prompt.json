You will need to recover the name of this function, as well as all variable names and types involved.\n2. You shall refactor the code structure based on your understanding, but you CANNOT change the functionality of the code.\n3. ***IMPORTANT*** You should eliminate all Non-idiomatic expressions (e.g., '*_DWORD', '*_QWORD', 'LOBYTE', 'HIBYTE' expression in IDA pro), and make the revised code as close as possible to the original source code.\n4. You should rename the anonymous function (e.g., sub_4DC7E2) and variables (e.g., v1, v2) with informative names, based on your understanding of the code.\n5.

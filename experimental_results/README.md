# Experimental results

The experimental results of the RQs in the paper is presented under this directory.

The results are in json format, in which each element contains the following contents (format of T1 and T2 are different):

```
    {
        "func_name": "...",  \\ name of the function
        "input": "...",  \\ input prompt to the LLM
        "output": "..."  \\ output by the LLM
    },
```

RQ4 is not here because all data invovled in RQ4 has been explicitly provided in the paper.
